# Prompt Engineering Techniques

This repository contains hands-on Jupyter notebooks covering core **prompt engineering concepts** using Large Language Models (LLMs).  
The materials are organized as part of a deep learning course and focus on practical techniques such as summarization, inferring, transforming, expanding, and building chatbots.
